A Pod is Kubernetes’ smallest scheduling unit, grouping one or more tightly coupled containers that must share network, storage, and lifecycle, enabling patterns like sidecars and init containers.

A secrets operator synchronizes external secrets into Kubernetes Secret objects for ease of use, while a CSI driver mounts secrets directly into Pods without storing them in etcd, providing a stronger security posture and better support for live rotation.

RBAC controls API access, not packet flow.


What a NetworkPolicy really is

A firewall rule for Pods, enforced at the network layer.

“A flat network means all east‑west traffic is allowed by default. It’s easy to start with, but dangerous at scale because a single compromise can reach everything. As platform engineers we gradually move to ‘default deny’ with NetworkPolicies, security groups, and proper segmentation.”

Introduce network segmentation:

Subnets/VPCs/VNETs for tiers (web, app, DB).

NSGs / security groups between them.

In Kubernetes:

Apply NetworkPolicies to restrict which namespaces/pods can talk to which.

Add zero‑trust style thinking:

Default deny, explicitly allow needed flows only.

Why webhooks matter for networking

They enforce:

NetworkPolicy must exist

No Pod without labels

No service exposed without approval

No egress without allowlist

This prevents human error, not just attacks.
