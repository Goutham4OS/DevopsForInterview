# Agile, Scrum, and DevOps – Quick Guide for Platform Engineers

This document is a concise, interview-focused explanation of **Agile**, **Scrum**, and **DevOps**, tailored for a Platform / DevOps Engineer working with microservices, CI/CD, and cloud platforms like Azure.

## 1. Agile – The Mindset

### 1.1 What is Agile?

Agile is a **set of values and principles** for developing software iteratively, delivering small increments frequently, and adapting to change based on feedback from users and stakeholders.[web:24]

**Agile Manifesto (4 key values):**[web:24]  
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

### 1.2 Why Agile?

Agile exists to solve the problems of **waterfall** style delivery: long cycles, late feedback, and big-bang releases that often fail.[web:26]

**Problems Agile solves:**
- Requirements change frequently (business/PO changes priorities).
- Big releases are risky and hard to roll back.
- Customers see the product too late and say “this is not what we wanted”.

**Agile approach:**
- Work in **small increments** (features/user stories).
- Deliver **early and often** (every 1–4 weeks).
- Get **feedback quickly** and adjust the backlog.

### 1.3 Simple Example – Microservices Product

Imagine an analytics platform with many microservices (similar to IRIS platform in the JD) where a customer asks for:

> “Add an alerting feature when CPU usage crosses 80% on AKS workloads.”

**Waterfall:**  
- Write full requirements, design everything, build for 6 months, deploy once.  
- Customer sees it after 6 months and says “we also need memory alerts, not just CPU”.

**Agile:**  
- Sprint 1: Basic CPU alert for one service, simple Grafana panel.  
- Demo to customer → they say “looks good, also add memory + custom thresholds”.  
- Sprint 2: Extend feature based on feedback.  
- Continuous improvement instead of guessing.

## 2. Scrum – Framework to Implement Agile

### 2.1 What is Scrum?

Scrum is a **specific Agile framework** with defined roles, events, and artifacts to implement Agile principles in a structured way.[web:27]  

You can say in interviews:  
> “Agile is the mindset; Scrum is one popular framework to implement Agile.”

### 2.2 Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner (PO)**  
  Owns the **Product Backlog**, prioritizes work based on business value and stakeholder input.

- **Scrum Master**  
  Facilitates Scrum, removes blockers, protects the team from external disruptions.

- **Development Team**  
  Cross-functional team (developers, QA, DevOps/platform engineers) delivering increments.

### 2.3 Scrum Events (Ceremonies)

1. **Sprint Planning**  
   - Decide **what** will be delivered in the sprint (selected PBIs) and **how** to do it.  
   - Use story points / capacity planning.

2. **Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)**  
   - 15-minute meeting.  
   - Each member answers:
     - What did I do yesterday?
     - What will I do today?
     - Any blockers?

3. **Sprint Review (Demo)**  
   - End of sprint.  
   - Team demonstrates completed work to PO and stakeholders.  
   - Collects feedback → backlog updates.

4. **Sprint Retrospective**  
   - Internal team discussion: what went well, what didn’t, how to improve next sprint.

### 2.4 Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog** – ordered list of features, bugs, technical tasks.  
- **Sprint Backlog** – subset of items chosen for the current sprint.  
- **Increment** – potentially shippable product at the end of the sprint.

### 2.5 Example – Your Context (Infra/Platform Team)

Suppose your platform team works on **AKS-based microservices** with CI/CD:

- **PO**: Wants:
  - New Helm chart for a Postgres StatefulSet.
  - Security hardening for privileged pods.
  - Terraform modules for hybrid cloud.

- **Sprint Planning**:
  - Choose PBIs:
    - “Create reusable AKS Terraform module”
    - “Add Gatekeeper policy to block privileged pods”
    - “Add PDB automation for AKS upgrades”

- **Daily Standups**:
  - You report:
    - “Yesterday: implemented Gatekeeper policy to deny privileged pods.”
    - “Today: integrate this policy into the Helm chart for app namespaces.”
    - “Blocker: need PO decision on which namespaces are exempt.”

- **Sprint Review**:
  - Demo:
    - Terraform module that creates AKS with standard tags and node pools.
    - Gatekeeper working: show that a privileged pod is rejected.
  - PO says: “Great, next sprint add documentation and self-service scripts.”

- **Retrospective**:
  - Team notes:
    - What went well: PDB automation reduced upgrade failures.
    - What didn’t: Estimates for Terraform work were too optimistic.
    - Action item: Break infra tasks into smaller stories next sprint.

## 3. DevOps – From Plan to Production

### 3.1 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a **set of practices, culture, and tools** that integrate development and operations to deliver software quickly, reliably, and safely.[web:23]

Key ideas:
- Break down silos between **Dev** and **Ops**.
- Automate as much as possible (CI/CD, testing, infra provisioning).
- Use **feedback loops** (logs, metrics, alerts) to continuously improve.

You can mention the **CALMS** model:[web:23][web:26]  
- Culture  
- Automation  
- Lean  
- Measurement  
- Sharing  

### 3.2 How DevOps Connects to Agile and Scrum

- Agile/Scrum decides **what** to build and in **what order** (PBIs, sprints).
- DevOps decides **how** that work moves from **code → build → test → deploy → run → monitor**.

In other words:
- **Agile/Scrum** = planning and feedback with humans (PO, team, stakeholders).  
- **DevOps** = technical pipeline and feedback from systems (CI, CD, monitoring, logging).

### 3.3 DevOps Practices (Concrete)

Typical DevOps practices in a microservices + cloud environment:

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**  
  - Every commit triggers:
    - Build (e.g., Docker image).
    - Unit tests.
    - Static code analysis.
    - Security scans (SCA, SAST, container scan).

- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**  
  - Deploy automatically to test/stage.  
  - Possibly auto-deploy to prod, or with approvals.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  - Terraform, ARM, Bicep, Ansible for cloud resources.  
  - Version-controlled, reviewed via PR.

- **Observability**  
  - Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana.  
  - Logs: ELK/Elastic, Azure Monitor.  
  - Traces: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, etc.

- **Security (DevSecOps)**  
  - Security integrated into pipelines (Snyk, Trivy, etc.).  
  - Policies enforced via tools like Gatekeeper/OPA.

## 4. How Agile, Scrum, and DevOps Work Together (Example)

### 4.1 Scenario: New Feature for Production Release

**Feature**: Add autoscaling and secure Postgres deployment for a new microservice on AKS.

1. **Agile/Scrum – Plan & Prioritize**
   - PO adds user stories:
     - “As a platform user, I need a secure Postgres Helm chart with backups.”
     - “As a platform user, I need HPA configured for the microservice.”
   - During **Sprint Planning**, team selects these for the next sprint.

2. **Development – Implementation**
   - DevOps/Platform engineer:
     - Writes Terraform for AKS node pools if needed.
     - Creates Helm chart templates (with PDB, resource limits, securityContext).
     - Configures HPA and probes.
   - All code in Git, PRs reviewed.

3. **DevOps – CI Pipeline**
   - On PR:
     - Build Docker images (multi-stage).
     - Run unit/integration tests.
     - Run security scans (Trivy/Snyk).
     - Run linting for Helm/Terraform.

4. **DevOps – CD Pipeline**
   - If CI passes:
     - Deploy to **dev** AKS via Helm/ArgoCD.
     - Run automated tests (e.g., smoke tests).
     - Deploy to **staging**.
     - Manual (or automated) approval for **prod**.

5. **Agile/Scrum – Feedback**
   - **Sprint Review**:
     - Demo new microservice scaling under load.
     - Show that Postgres runs with proper backups and security policies.
   - Stakeholders give feedback:
     - “Add alerting on failed backups.”
   - That feedback becomes new PBIs for future sprints.

6. **DevOps – Monitoring and Improvement**
   - Prometheus/Grafana dashboards show CPU, memory, DB metrics.
   - Alerts inform team of any issue in prod.
   - Issues discovered feed into:
     - **Backlog items** (Agile/Scrum).
     - **Pipeline improvements** (DevOps).
