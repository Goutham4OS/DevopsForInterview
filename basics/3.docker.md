# Notes:
Docker is not about shipping code.
Docker is about controlling Linux processes safely and reproducibly.

Docker gives us a consistent, portable runtime for each microservice

VMs virtualize hardware; containers virtualize the OS.

Docker images are a stack of read-only layers; containers add a writable layer on top. A union filesystem like OverlayFS merges these layers, giving a single filesystem view with copy-on-write semantics.

A Docker container is a process (or set of processes) running on a host OS, isolated via namespaces and cgroups, with a layered root filesystem provided by OverlayFS.
